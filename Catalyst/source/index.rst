Cloud platforms can provide a powerful new paradigm to strengthen traditional Software Development and Testing activities. With software development activities happening across distributed locations and different time zones, there is need to strengthen collaboration, use Agile Methodologies and scalable infrastructure to support the complex needs. Relevance Lab provides an integrated Collaboration Workspace for distributed teams, Engineering Life Cycle Tools based on Agile Delivery Models, On-Demand Infrastructure and Best Practices for building scalable products.
Relevance Lab provides a transition model named as RL Catalyst that can help incrementally increase the maturity of your in-house software development activities by leveraging best practices of Cloud-Ready Dev and Testing platforms.
