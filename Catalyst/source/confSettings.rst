 




Config Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Config Setup we will cover Chef Server, Puppet Server and Environment:

The Chef server is the highly scalable foundation of the Chef automation platform. Create a flexible, dynamic infrastructure across multiple datacenters, public and private clouds, and in heterogeneous environments.

Puppet master is a Ruby application that compiles configurations for any number of Puppet agent nodes, using Puppet code and various other data sources. (For more info, see Overview of Puppet's Architecture.)

An Environment is a way to map an organization's real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed.
