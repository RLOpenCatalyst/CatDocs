^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Config Setup we will cover Chef Server and Puppet Server:

The Chef server is the highly scalable foundation of the Chef automation platform. Create a flexible, dynamic infrastructure across multiple datacenters, public and private clouds, and in heterogeneous environments.

Puppet master is a Ruby application that compiles configurations for any number of Puppet agent nodes, using Puppet code and various other data sources. (For more info, see Overview of Puppet's Architecture.)
