Nexus Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nexus is a repository manager. It allows you to proxy, collect, and manage your dependencies so that you are not constantly juggling a collection of JARs. It makes it easy to distribute your software. Internally, you configure your build to publish artifacts to Nexus and they then become available to other developers. You get the benefits of having your own ‘central’, and there is no easier way to collaborate.

RLCatalyst works with different repositories where you have kept your artifacts . If you have a nexus repository, add it here

To configure a new Nexus server follow the steps below:

 * From the main menu click on Settings
 * Once you click on Settings, from the side menu click on Devops Roles 
 * Click on Nexus Server
 * Click on New button provided
 * Enter the Nexus server name in the Nexus Server Name field
 * Enter nexus server username in the User Name field
 * Enter nexus server password in the Password field
 * Enter nexus server URL in the Nexus Server URL field
 * Choose the organization from the Organization drop down list
 * Click on + icon present next to Nexus Group ID Details and enter valid Nexus GroupID and save
