.. note:: RLCatalyst is powered by Chef . It works with both hosted and enterprise Chef.RLCatalyst 
    installed using AWS AMI will have a chef server bundled and the data will be already 
    available in Settings

    If you have installed RLCatalyst from source or using vagrant or Docker Image ,you need to 
    have a hosted chef server account . If you dont have one, please create one account using the
    help at :ref:`configure-chef`  

    ``Note: Make sure , chef server is loaded with automation libraries . If you are using your own``
    ``chef server account and no automation libraries are available, upload the automation libraries``
    ``provided by Relevance Lab.`` Please refer to :ref:`upload-cookbooks` for more details.
